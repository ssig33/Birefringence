# What ?
I created this piece of shit instead of Fluid or Mozilla Prism. It work for Windows and Linux.

I know no one want Mozilla Prism on 2016 but I want.

# Usage
You must install nodejs and ruby.

example.

``` sh
  $ ruby app.rb http://irccloud.com IRCCloud
```

And see workdir.

# Do you want to set an Icon for your App?

# Risk
**If website had evil code that attack electron, attackes can run arbitrary code on your fucking computer.**

WTFPL.
